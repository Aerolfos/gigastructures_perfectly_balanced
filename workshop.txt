[h2]As all things should be.[/h2]

Updated to 3.4, and should work for all subsequent sub-versions of 3.4.

[u]If your launcher claims incompatibility, try resubscribing to the mod on the workshop first - mods do not always update properly.[/u]

This mod makes miscellaneous changes to the Gigastructures mod out of personal preference. Right now it doesn't do much - base gigas "stole" my changes.

[u]To-do:[/u] Add a game start event to configure changes. Everything below should be toggleable.

[h2]Changes[/h2]
[u]Megastructure caps:[/u]
Federations now have their own version of the per-country cap for 
[list]
    [*]Neutronium Gigaforge
    [*]Attack Moon
    [*]Behemoth Planetcraft
[/list]
As such, if game cap is 1 and you join a federation where a member has a moon, you are no longer able to build new moons.
Consider the feature experimental, report weird edge-cases that happen. 

Losing a moon/planet subtracts 1 from cap for both player and federation, repairing a moon adds 1 to cap for both (this does not happen in vanilla gigas and is a pain to account for all edge-cases...)

[u]Localization:[/u]
[list]
    [*]Renames the new Birch Void Sphere into "Elowiny Sphere".
[/list]
Yes, this is obviously a critically important change.

[h2]Integrated/obsolete Changes[/h2]
[u]Neutronium Gigaforge:[/u]
[list]
    [*]-50% alloy production on all stages (final stage before: 750 after: 375)
    [*]-50% energy upkeep on all stages (final stage before: 1250 after: 625)
    [*]Half of the upkeep is now mineral upkeep (final stage before: 0 after: 625)
	[*]Alloy cost has been increased on all stages
[/list]
[u]Gigaforge now has halved alloy production in base gigas.[/u]

[u]Ruined Attack Moon:[/u]
All ruined moons and planetcraft are removed 5 days after game start.
It is still possible to upgrade ruined moons, like for example after losing one in combat, but there won't be any on the map.
[u]Gigas lets you configure ruined warship appearance rates on its own now (which is a better feature than this anyway).[/u]

[u]Gas Giant Habitat:[/u]
Received their own district set (previously reused elysium and equatorial shipyard districts partially).
Own set of planetary designations, but is just a copy of vanilla habitat ones (would have to overwrite vanilla if they weren't separate)
Max allowed size is now 30 (was 25).
Ideal planet class (always 100% habitability, like habitats) - this change is debatable. Can use modifier for 100% hab for origin, and leave rest alone. Not sure.
Districts brought in line with vanilla habitats. 
All districts cost 400 minerals now (was 500).
[list]
    [*]Habitation District - +8 Housing +1 Clerks/2 Maintenance Drones (and Bug branch rooftop farmer civic is now accounted for) +1 Building Slot - Upkeep 2 Energy
    [*]Industrial District - +3 Housing +1 Metallurgist +1 Artisan - Upkeep 2 Energy
    [*]Research District - +3 Housing +3 Researchers - Upkeep 2 Energy
    [*]Energy District - +4 Housing +4 Technicians (1 extra) - Upkeep 2 Energy
	[*]Gas Harvester District - +3 Housing +3 Gas Harvesters (buffed) - Upkeep 3 Energy
[/list]
Gas harvesters now produce 2 exotic gas (was 1.5) for no upkeep as they are worker jobs (was 8 energy and 3 minerals(!)).
Fluffy plains deposits are twice as powerful, giving 4 potential gas districts each.
The special buildings actually do something:
[list]
	[*]Atmospheric Fusion Facility - 500 minerals, upkeep 5 energy - 10 minerals production, 1 matter synthesizer job per 10 pops
    [*]Atmospheric Mote Extractor - 500 minerals, upkeep 2 energy - 2 volatile motes production, 1 mote harvester job per 20 pops
    [*]Floater Analysis Complex - 600 minerals, upkeep 4 energy - 20 society research, 1 researcher job per 25 pops
[/list]
[u]Taken directly from this mod into base gigas (with my encouragement).[/u]
